# Fast ATK % finder

Fast ATK % finder is a <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> Script to help find in the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1827980/Idle_Spiral/">Idle Spiral</a> rewards that are Rare.

Since the script is set up to search by color, it will force you to stop clicking every time something with the color of Rare Reward is found. 

Make sure you ran this with the game in full screen just in case, i still have not tested if it will work in windowed mode.

Since it is searching by color, it also means that in any battle you can filter by the rare rewards.

You can use other tolls to auto click the Reroll Reward if you want, just make sure it matches the speed of the Script, otherwise it will be useless.


# How To Use It

Start the script as any other and open the game window, once there press F2 to start. 

Every rare reward will force your mouse to move to the text so if it's not what you are looking for you need to press F2 to stop and reroll once to clear the color.
